      <description>Yesterday we got this argument from Manuel in favor of Biles: After suffering so many bad gymnastics (mathematical, logical, statistical, you name it) at seminars, to have some performed by a true champion would be a welcome change.

      <description>From an interesting statistics-laden piece by &amp;#8220;Dean Dad&amp;#8221;: Far more community college students transfer prior to completing the Associate’s degree than actually complete first. According to a new report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, about 350,000 transfer before completion, compared to about 60,000 who complete first. That matters in several ways. Most basically, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I was surprised to see so little action in the comments yesterday. Sure, Liebling&amp;#8217;s an obscure figure&amp;#8212;I guess at this point he&amp;#8217;d be called a &amp;#8220;cult writer,&amp;#8221; and I just happen to be part of the cult, fan as I am of mid-twentieth-century magazine writing&amp;#8212;but I&amp;#8217;d&amp;#8217;ve thought Bourdain would&amp;#8217;ve aroused more interest.

      <description>The latest minor release of the forecast package has now been approved on CRAN and should be available in the next day or so. Version 8.5 contains the following new features Updated tsCV() to handle exogenous regressors. Reimplemented naive(), snaive(), rwf() for substantial speed improvements. Added support for passing arguments to auto.arima() unit root tests. Improved auto.arima() stepwise search algorithm (some neighbouring models were missed previously). We haven’t done a major release for two years, and there is unlikely to be another one now.</description>

      <description>What makes for a good data scientist? This is a question I asked a long time ago and am still trying to figure out the answer. Seven years ago, I wrote:
 I was thinking about the people who I think are really good at data analysis and it occurred to me that they were all people I knew. So I started thinking about people that I don’t know (and there are many) but are equally good at data analysis.</description>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;#8216;s decision was pretty easy, as almost all the commenters talked about Steve Martin, pro and con. Letterman was pretty much out of the picture. Indeed, the best argument in favor of Letterman came from Jonathan, who wrote: I’ll go with Letterman because he looks like he could use the work. Conversely, the strongest argument &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;#8216;s matchup featured a food writer vs. a tennis player, two professions that are not known for public speaking. The best arguments came in the very first two comments. Jeff wrote: Fisher’s first book was “Serve It Forth,” which seems like good advice in tennis, as well. So, you’d get a two-fer there.

      <description>It’s been a tough weekend, not least because Tar Heels lost at home. Sometimes I feel like I’m vested too much in the outcome of the Heel’s basketball games, and if my emotional rollercoaster the rest of the weekend gives any clue, I probably am, just a litttle bit. I tried to shake it off, yet it wasn’t particularly easy, not only because we lost at home, but because the loss was the worst one at home under Roy Williams.</description>

      <description>OK, our last matchup wasn&amp;#8217;t close. Adam Schiff (unseeded in the &amp;#8220;people whose name ends in f&amp;#8221; category) had the misfortune to go against the juggernaut that was Babe Didrikson Zaharias (seeded #2 in the GOATs category).

ggplot2 is unbreakable! You might want to debug() the methods of Geoms or Stats.

      <description>In episode 71 of Not So Standard Deviations, Hilary Parker and I inaugurated our first “Data Science Design Challenge” segment where we discussed how we would solve a given problem using data science. The idea with calling it a “design challenge” was to contrast it with common “hackathon” type models where you are presented with an already-collected dataset and then challenged to find something interesting in the data. Here, we wanted to start with a problem and then talk about how data might be collected and analyzed to address the problem.</description>

      <description>PCA is a critical method for dimension reduction for high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). However, this is changing with single-cell RNAseq data. Now, we can sequence millions (n) of single cells and each cell has ~20,000 genes/features (p).
I suggest you read my previous blog post on using svd to calculate PCs.

      <description>A popular approach to forecasting macroeconomic variables is to utilize a large number of predictors. Several regularization and shrinkage methods can be used to exploit such high-dimensional datasets, and have been shown to improve forecast accuracy for the US economy. To assess whether similar results hold for economies with different characteristics, an Australian dataset containing observations on 151 aggregate and disaggregate economic series as well as 185 international variables, is introduced.</description>

      <description>The International Institute of Forecasters has established interest group sections, devoted to specialized domains of forecasting. One of the first such sections will be for early career researchers. So if you are a PhD student, post-doc, or otherwise a relatively junior researcher working in forecasting, this is for you! The first events will be during the ISF in Thessaloniki in June 2019, including the following: ECR welcoming event. A meet and great event prior to the ISF welcome reception.</description>

      <description>Forecasting competitions are now so widespread that it is often forgotten how controversial they were when first held, and how influential they have been over the years. I briefly review the history of forecasting competitions, and discuss what we have learned about their design and implementation, and what they can tell us about forecasting. I also provide a few suggestions for potential future competitions, and for research about forecasting based on competitions.</description>

      <description>This paper investigates early event classification in spatio-temporal data streams. We propose a framework for early classification that considers the relationship between the features of an event and its age. The framework incorporates an event extraction algorithm as well as two early event classification algorithms, which use a series of logistic regression classifiers with penalty terms and state space models. We apply this framework to synthetic and real world problems and demonstrate its reliability and broad applicability.</description>

      <description>PCA in practice. Principle Component Analysis(PCA) is a very important skill for dimention reduction to analyze high-dimentional data. High-dimentional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). This types of data are very commonly generated from high-throuput sequencing experiments. For example, an RNA-seq or microarry experiment measures expression of tens of thousands of genes for only 8 samples (4 controls and 4 treatments).

Anyway, now that we know the score, we can reflect on some of the cognitive biases that led us to stick with the &amp;#8220;hot hand fallacy&amp;#8221; story for so long. Jason Collins [&amp;#8230;]

      <description>This week I’ve been attending the Functional Data and Beyond workshop at the Matrix centre in Creswick. I spoke yesterday about using ggplot2 for functional data graphics, rather than the custom-built plotting functionality available in the many functional data packages, including my own rainbow package written with Hanlin Shang. It is a much more powerful and flexible way to work, so I thought it would be useful to share some examples.</description>

      <description>In data analysis, we make use of a lot of theory, whether we like to admit it or not. In a traditional statistical training, things like the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers (and their many variations) are deeply baked into our heads. I probably use the central limit theorem everyday in my work, sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse. Even if I’m not directly applying a Normal approximation, knowledge of the central limit theorem will often guide my thinking and help me to decide what to do in a given data analytic situation.</description>

      <description>Presentation to ACEMS/MATRIX Conference on Functional Data Analysis Functional autoregressive models have been widely used in functional time series analysis, but no attention has been given to handling seasonality within this framework. I will discuss a proposed seasonal functional autoregressive model, and explore some of its statistical properties including stationarity conditions and limiting behaviour. I will also look at methods for estimation and prediction of seasonal functional autoregressive time series of order one.</description>

Here, I will discuss the differences between the two concepts so that we can answer the question why weather forecasting is not called weather prediction.

For this purpose, you fit a model to a training data set, which results in an estimator (\hat{f}(x)) that can make predictions for new samples &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For classification problems, classifier performance is typically defined according to the confusion matrix associated with the classifier. Based on the entries of the matrix, it is possible to compute sensitivity (recall), specificity, and precision. For a single cutoff, these quantities lead to balanced accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) or to the F1-score (recall and precision). For evaluate a scoring classifier at multiple cutoffs, these quantities can be used to determine the area under the ROC curve (AUC) or the area under the precision-recall curve &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Although there are increasing incentives and pressures for researchers to share code (even for projects that are not essentially computational), practices vary widely and standards are mostly non-existent. The practice of reviewing code then falls to researchers and research groups before publication.

      <description>A few months ago, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect when looking at fluorescence microscopy images in published papers. I looked at the accompanying graph to understand the data or the point the authors were trying to make. Often, the graph represents one or more measures of the so-called co-localization, but I couldn’t figure out how to interpret them. It turned out; reading the images is simple. Cells are simultaneously stained by two dyes (say, red and green) for two different &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Presentation to the Monash international workshop on time series and panel data It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time. Data visualization is essential for exploring and understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual observations. However, the sheer quantity of data available means that new time series visualisation methods are needed. I will demonstrate an approach to this problem using a vector of features on each time series, measuring characteristics of the series.</description>

      <description>Recently I’ve been thinking on the subject of asking for help. In short, it’s hard to ask for help. It involves admitting to yourself that you can’t solve the problem alone, opening yourself up, hoping that another person will understand you and guide you in the right direction. Thus it can be painful if your request for help is misunderstood, met with criticism or ignored. Regardless of these obstacles, I think that the potential rewards make it worth it.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re always discussing election results on three levels: their direct political consequences, their implications for future politics, and what we can infer about public opinion. In 2018 the Democrats broadened their geographic base, as we can see in this graph from Yair Ghitza: Party balancing At the national level, what happened is what we expected [&amp;#8230;]

The 2018 electorate was younger than in 2014, though not as young as exit polls suggest. 2.

      <description>Programmers, including myself, make cosmetic changes in code all the time, such as adding or deleting white spaces or blank lines, or re-wrapping lines, or adding { } to single-line if statements. That is usually fine. However, when making changes in other people&amp;rsquo;s code and sending pull requests on Github, I suggest you refrain from introducing cosmetic changes. There are two reasons: Such changes require unnecessary attention of the pull</description>

      <description>River water-quality monitoring is increasingly conducted using automated in situ sensors, enabling timelier identification of unexpected values. However, anomalies caused by technical issues confound these data, while the volume and velocity of data prevent manual detection. We present a framework for automated anomaly detection in high-frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors, using turbidity, conductivity and river level data. After identifying end-user needs and defining anomalies, we ranked their importance and selected suitable detection methods.</description>

      <description>A particular focus of water-quality monitoring is the concentrations of sediments and nutrients in rivers, constituents that can smother biota and cause eutrophication. However, the physical and economic constraints of manual sampling prohibit data collection at the frequency required to capture adequately the variation in concentrations through time. Here, we developed models to predict total suspended solids (TSS) and oxidized nitrogen (NOx) concentrations based on high-frequency time series of turbidity, conductivity and river level data from low-cost in situ sensors in rivers flowing into &amp;hellip;</description>
