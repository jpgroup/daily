description: A few months ago, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect when looking at
  fluorescence microscopy images in published papers. I looked at the accompanying
  graph to understand the data or the point the authors were trying to make. Often,
  the graph represents one or more measures of the so-called co-localization, but
  I couldn’t figure out how to interpret them. It turned out; reading the images is
  simple. Cells are simultaneously stained by two dyes (say, red and green) for two
