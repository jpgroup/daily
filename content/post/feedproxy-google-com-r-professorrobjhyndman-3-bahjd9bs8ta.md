title: Calendar-based graphics for visualizing people's daily schedules

description: Calendars are broadly used in society to display temporal information
  and events. This paper describes a new calendar display for plotting data, that
  includes a layout algorithm with many options, and faceting functionality. The functions
  use modular arithmetic on the date variable to restructure the data into a calendar
  format. The user can apply the grammar of graphics to create plots inside each calendar
  cell, and thus the displays synchronize neatly with ggplot2 graphics.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/BaHJd9BS8tA"
