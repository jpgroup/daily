  Objective Length of hospital stay (LOS) is considered a vital component for successful colorectal surgery treatment. Evidence of an association between hospital surgery volume and LOS has been mixed. Data modelling techniques may adversely impact conclusions to the extent of reversing them. This study applied techniques to overcome possible drawbacks.
  Method An additive quantile regression model formulated to isolate hospital contextual effects was applied to every colorectal surgery for cancer conducted in Victoria Australia between 2005 and 2015: 28,343 admissions in 90 Victorian ...
