   <p>This morning I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/nickchk/status/1402518644542771200">an interesting tweet by Nick
  HK</a>, who ran a
  simulation to convince himself of the fact that OLS consistency only requires
  Corr(X, ε) = 0 but not independence:</p> <blockquote>
  <p>I still find it hard to believe that OLS consistency only relies on X being
  uncorrelated with ε, not independent of ε, and I occasionally run a simulation
  to re-convince myself.</p>
  </blockquote> <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3a_NX5VIAAv6mL?format=png&amp;name=small" alt="Nick's
