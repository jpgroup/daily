title: Macroeconomic forecasting for Australia using a large number of predictors

description: A popular approach to forecasting macroeconomic variables is to utilize
  a large number of predictors. Several regularization and shrinkage methods can be
  used to exploit such high-dimensional datasets, and have been shown to improve forecast
  accuracy for the US economy. To assess whether similar results hold for economies
  with different characteristics, an Australian dataset containing observations on
  151 aggregate and disaggregate economic series as well as 185 international variables,
  is introduced.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/slb0tIhveEg"
