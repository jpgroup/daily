description: We propose an automated method for obtaining weighted forecast combinations
  using time series features. The proposed approach involves two phases. First, we
  use a collection of time series to train a meta-model to assign weights to various
  possible forecasting methods with the goal of minimizing the average forecasting
  loss obtained from a weighted forecast combination. The inputs to the meta-model
  are features extracted from each series. In the second phase, we forecast new series
  using a weighted forecast combination where the weights are obtained from our previously
  trained meta-model.<img  ...
