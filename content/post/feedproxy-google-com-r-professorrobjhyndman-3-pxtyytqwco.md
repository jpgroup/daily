description: This paper investigates early event classification in spatio-temporal
  data streams, where events need to be classified using partial information, i.e.
  while the event is still ongoing. The framework incorporates two early event classification
  algorithms with different strengths as well as an event extraction algorithm. We
  apply this framework to synthetic and real world problems and demonstrate its reliability
  and broad applicability. The algorithms and data are available in the R package
  eventstream, and other code in the supplementary material.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Profess
