   <p>Yesterday was an extremely exciting day for me and my colleagues. We finished a project we had been working on and shared it with the world. Meaning, it’s done and we can relax for a little bit while we wait for feedback from our peers.</p>
  <p>But this was not any project, at least not for me. Why do you ask? In general terms, it involved an analysis that you could not search on Google and find the answer for. That is, it involved diving into the unknown!</p>
