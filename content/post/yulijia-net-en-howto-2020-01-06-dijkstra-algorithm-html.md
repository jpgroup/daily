  <blockquote> <p>If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.</p> <p>—Edsger W. Dijkstra (cannot find the citation, this may be fabricated)</p>
  </blockquote> <p>Dijkstra’s algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The more common algorithm fixes a single node as the initial node and finds shortest paths from the initial node to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.</p> <p>The steps for implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm are ...
