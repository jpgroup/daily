  In this post I will explain the history behind BaseSet then a brief introduction to sets, followed by showing what you can do with BaseSet.
  Brief BaseSet history I study diseases to try to find what causes them at a research institute associated with an hospital. Thanks to recent technological advances we can analyze many things from a single patient&rsquo;s sample. Having so much information available can be overwhelming, making it difficult to find the causes of diseases (but it is much better than not having enough ...
