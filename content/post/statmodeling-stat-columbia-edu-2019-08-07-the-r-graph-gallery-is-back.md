description: We&#8217;ve recommended the R graph gallery before, but then it got taken
  down. But now it&#8217;s back! I wouldn&#8217;t use it on its own as a teaching
  tool, in that it has a lot of graphs that I would not recommend (see here), but
  it&#8217;s a great resource, so thanks so much to Yan Holtz ...
