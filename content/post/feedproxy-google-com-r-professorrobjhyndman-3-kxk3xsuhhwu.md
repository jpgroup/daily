description: The HDoutliers algorithm is a powerful unsupervised algorithm for detecting
  anomalies in high-dimensional data, with a strong theoretical foundation. However,
  it suffers from some limitations that significantly hinder its performance level,
  under certain circumstances. In this article, we propose an algorithm that addresses
  these limitations. We define an anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly
  from the majority with a large distance gap. An approach based on extreme value
  theory is used for the anomalous threshold calculation.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHynd
