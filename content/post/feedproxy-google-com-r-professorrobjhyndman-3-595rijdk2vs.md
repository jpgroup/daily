description: Hierarchical forecasting methods have been widely used to support aligned
  decision-making by providing coherent forecasts at different aggregation levels.
  Traditional hierarchical forecasting approaches, such as the bottom-up and top-down
  methods, focus on a particular aggregation level to anchor the forecasts. During
  the past decades, these have been replaced by a variety of linear combination approaches
  that exploit information from the complete hierarchy to produce more accurate forecasts.
