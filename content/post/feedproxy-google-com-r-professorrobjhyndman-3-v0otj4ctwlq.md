  There is a new suite of packages for tidy time series analysis, that integrates easily into the tidyverse way of working. We call these the tidyverts packages, and they are available at tidyverts.org. Much of the work on these packages has been done by Earo Wang and Mitchell O’Hara-Wild.
  The first of the packages to make it to CRAN was tsibble, providing the data infrastructure for tidy temporal data with wrangling tools.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/V0oTJ4CtWlQ" height="1" width="1" ...
