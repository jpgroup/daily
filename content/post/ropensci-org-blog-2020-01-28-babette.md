  babette 1 is a package to work with BEAST2 2, a software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis from R.
  babette is a spin-off of my own academic research. As a PhD I work on models of diversification: mathematical descriptions of how species form new species. Instead of working on a species&rsquo; individuals, I work on species as evolutionary lineages. A good way to show the evolutionary relationships between species are ...
