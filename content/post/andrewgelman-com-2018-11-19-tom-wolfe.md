  <p>I&#8217;m a big Tom Wolfe fan. My favorites are The Painted Word and From Bauhaus to Our House, and I have no patience for the boosters (oh, sorry, &#8220;experts&#8221;) of modern art of the all-black-painting variety or modern architecture of the can&#8217;t-find-the-front-door variety who can&#8217;t handle Wolfe&#8217;s criticism. I also enjoyed Bonfire of the Vanities, [&#8230;]</p>
