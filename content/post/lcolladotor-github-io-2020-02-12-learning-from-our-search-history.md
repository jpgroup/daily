  <h3>Origin of the idea</h3>
  <p>Recently the team I work with has had a few new members and I’ve been thinking lately of ways we could try to help them. The team leader was traveling this week, which gave me the opportunity to come up with a new type of session and test it out. That’s the origin of this <em>learning from our search history</em> idea. We tested it today and I’m quite happy with the results so far, so I thought it would be useful to document what we did and share it with others.</p>
