description: This paper provides a non-systematic review of the progress of forecasting
  in social settings. It is aimed at someone outside the field of forecasting, wanting
  to appreciate the results of the M4 Competition by reading a survey paper to get
  informed about the state of the art of this discipline. It discusses the recorded
  improvements over time in forecast accuracy, the need to capture forecast uncertainty,
  and what can go wrong with predictions.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/yPL2ka6q1aw"
