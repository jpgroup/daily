description: <p>The goal of scclusteval(Single Cell Cluster Evaluation) is to evaluate
  the single cell clustering stability by boostrapping/subsampling the cells and provide
  many visualization methods for comparing clusters.</p> <p>for Theory behind the
  method, see Christian Henning, “Cluster-wise assessment of cluster stability,” Research
