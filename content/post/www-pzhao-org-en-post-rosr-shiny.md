  <p>&lsquo;rosr&rsquo; is an R package for creating reproducible academic project
  with integrated various academic elements, including data, bibliography, codes,
  images, manuscripts, dissertations, slides and so on. These elements are well connected
  so that they can be easily synchronized and updated. Users don&rsquo;t have to repeat
  copying and pasting their results and figures from time to time. It will be easy
  for the scientific researchers to use, even if they are R beginners, or even non-R-users.</p>
