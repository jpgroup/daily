description: The explosion of time series data in recent years has brought a flourish
  of new time series analysis methods, for forecasting, clustering, classification
  and other tasks. The evaluation of these new methods requires either collecting
  or simulating a diverse set of time series benchmarking data to enable reliable
  comparisons against alternative approaches. We propose GeneRAting TIme Series with
  diverse and controllable characteristics, named GRATIS, with the use of mixture
  autoregressive (MAR) models.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/oRSjvaL0Whg"
