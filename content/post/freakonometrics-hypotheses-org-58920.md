description: Our paper, with Emmanuel Flachaire, &#8220;Pareto models for risk management&#8221;
  is now online&#8230; The Pareto model is very popular in risk management, since
  simple analytical formulas can be derived for financial downside risk measures (Value-at-Risk,
  Expected Shortfall) or reinsurance premiums and related quantities (Large Claim
  Index, Return Period). Nevertheless, in practice, distributions are (strictly) Pareto
  only in the tails, above (possible very) large threshold. Therefore, it could be
  interesting to take into account second order behavior to provide a better fit.
