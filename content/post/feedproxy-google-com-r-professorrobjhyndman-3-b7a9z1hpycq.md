description: Talk to be given at rstudio::conf, San Francisco. Over the last few years,
  Rmarkdown seems to have taken over my life, or at least my written communication.
  These days I use Rmarkdown to maintain my website, write my blog, write textbooks,
  write academic papers, prepare slides for talks, keep my CV up-to-date, help my
  students write theses, prepare university policy documents, write letters, prepare
  exams, write reports for clients, and more.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/B7A9z1HPYCQ"
