description: This paper discusses several modern approaches to regression analysis
  involving time series data where some of the predictor variables are also indexed
  by time. We discuss classical statistical approaches as well as methods that have
  been proposed recently in the machine learning literature. The approaches are compared
  and contrasted, and it will be seen that there are advantages and disadvantages
  to most currently available approaches. There is ample room for methodological developments
  in this area.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/OtPfc59UmcY"
