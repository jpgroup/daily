description: Forecasting competitions are now so widespread that it is often forgotten
  how controversial they were when first held, and how influential they have been
  over the years. I briefly review the history of forecasting competitions, and discuss
  what we have learned about their design and implementation, and what they can tell
  us about forecasting. I also provide a few suggestions for potential future competitions,
  and for research about forecasting based on competitions.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/L5eP0FJ7wQY"
