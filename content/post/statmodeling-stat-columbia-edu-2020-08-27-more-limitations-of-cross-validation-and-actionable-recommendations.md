description: This post is by Aki. Tuomas Sivula, Måns Magnusson, and I (Aki) have
  a new preprint paper that analyzes one of the limitations of cross-validation Uncertainty
  in Bayesian Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation Based Model Comparison. Normal distribution
  has been used to present the uncertainty in cross-validation for a single model
  and in model comparison at least since ...
