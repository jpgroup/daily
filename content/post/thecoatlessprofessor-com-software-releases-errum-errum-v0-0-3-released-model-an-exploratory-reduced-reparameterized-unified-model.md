  The errum package provides a high-performance implementation of the Exploratory reduced Reparameterized Unified Model (ErRUM) described by Culpepper and Chen (2018). Development of this model followed from Chen et al. (2018)&rsquo;s work on estimating the Q-matrix within a cognitive diagnostic model (CDM). With the package now on CRAN, this is the first time an exploratory model has been made available publically!
