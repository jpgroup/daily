source: Alison Hill
description: <p>In this talk, Alison will talk about one plot’s life cycle, from a
  sad Powerpoint slide to an Excel chart and finally to the finished product made
  with the ggplot2 package in R. Along the way, she will discuss why each version
  of the plot fails in different ways and how each iteration improved on the last
  one.</p> <p><img src="https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides_files/figure-html/animated.gif"
