description: The Misconception The relative belief ratio (e.g., Evans 2015, Horwich
  1982/2016) equals the marginal likelihood. The Correction The relative belief ratio
  is proportional to the marginal likelihood. Dividing two marginal likelihoods (i.e.,
  computing a Bayes factor) cancels the constant of proportionality, such that the
  Bayes factor equals the ratio of two complementary relative belief ratios ...
