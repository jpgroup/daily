  <p>PCA is a critical method for dimension reduction for high-dimensional data.
  High-dimensional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n).
  However, this is changing with single-cell RNAseq data. Now, we can sequence millions (n)
  of single cells and each cell has ~20,000 genes/features (p).</p>
  <p>I suggest you read my <a href="https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/pca-in-action/">previous blog post</a> on using <code>svd</code> to calculate PCs.</p>
