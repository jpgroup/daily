description: Presentation to the Monash international workshop on time series and
  panel data It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very
  large amounts of data over time. Data visualization is essential for exploring and
  understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual observations. However,
  the sheer quantity of data available means that new time series visualisation methods
  are needed. I will demonstrate an approach to this problem using a vector of features
  on each time series, measuring characteristics of the series.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Professo
