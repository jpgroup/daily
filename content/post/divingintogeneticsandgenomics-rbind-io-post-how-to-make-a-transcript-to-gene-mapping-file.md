  <p>I need a transcript to gene mapping file for <code>Salmon</code>. I am aware of annotation <code>bioconductor</code> packages that can do this job. However, I was working on a species which does not have the annotation in a package format (I am going to use Drosphila as an example for this blog post). I had to go and got the gtf file and made such a file from scratch.</p>
  <p>Please read the <a href="https://useast.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html">specifications</a> of those two file formats.</p>
