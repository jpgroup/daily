description: Accurate forecasts of macroeconomic variables are crucial inputs into
  the decisions of economic agents and policy makers. Exploiting inherent aggregation
  structures of such variables, we apply forecast reconciliation methods to generate
  forecasts that are coherent with the aggregation constraints. We generate both point
  and probabilistic forecasts for the first time in the macroeconomic setting. Using
  Australian GDP we show that forecast reconciliation not only returns coherent forecasts
  but also improves the overall forecast accuracy in both point and probabilistic
  frameworks.<img ...
