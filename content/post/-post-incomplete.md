  <p>Not sure if I will ever finish these, but the incomplete versions make it pretty clear what needs to be added to make them complete.
  It&rsquo;s all perculating somewhere in my head, pretty much formulated, but writing it down is another matter. In the first paper the notion of sharp quadratic majorization is generalized using <em>fans</em> of majorizers. In the second paper formulas are given for the convergence rate of majorization algorithms with equality and/or inequality ...
