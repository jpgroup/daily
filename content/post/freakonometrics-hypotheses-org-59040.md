description: Cochran Theorem &#8211; from The distribution of quadratic forms in a
  normal system, with applications to the analysis of covariance published in 1934
  &#8211; is probably the most import one in a regression course. It is an application
  of a nice result on quadratic forms of Gaussian vectors. More precisely, we can
  prove that if is a random vector with variable then (i) if is a (squared) idempotent
  matrix where is the rank of matrix , and (ii) conversely, if then is an idempotent
