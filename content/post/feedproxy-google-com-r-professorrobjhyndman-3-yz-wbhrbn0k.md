  Presentation to the Australasian Actuarial Education and Research Symposium It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect huge amounts of data over time. Traditional time series methods are not well suited to this new paradigm. I will review some new tools that have been developed to analyse large collections of time series including visualization, anomaly detection and forecasting.
  Data visualization is essential for exploring and understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual observations.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/YZ-Wb ...
