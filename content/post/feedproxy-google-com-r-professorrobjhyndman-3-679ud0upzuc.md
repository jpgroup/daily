description: Forecasting plays a critical role in the development of organisational
  business strategies. Despite a considerable body of research in the area of forecasting,
  the focus has largely been on the financial and economic outcomes of the forecasting
  process as opposed to societal benefits. Our motivation in this study is to promote
  the latter, with a view to using the forecasting process to advance social and environmental
  objectives such as equality, social justice and sustainability.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/679Ud0UPZUc"
