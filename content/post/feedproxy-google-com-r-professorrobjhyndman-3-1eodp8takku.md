title: Optimal non-negative forecast reconciliation

description: The sum of forecasts of disaggregated time series are often required
  to equal the forecast of the aggregate, giving a set of coherent forecasts. The
  least squares solution for finding coherent forecasts uses a reconciliation approach
  known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya et al (2019). The MinT approach and its
  variants do not guarantee that the coherent forecasts are non-negative, even when
  all of the original forecasts are non-negative in nature.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/1EoDP8takkU"
