  useful and widely employed tool to gauge and compare measurements. For instance,
  z-scores help to compare the relative position of some measurements with respect
  to their distributions. In this post, we will prove some basic (algebraic) properties
  of z-values. There’s nothing new to that, it’s just I’d like to have it neat and
