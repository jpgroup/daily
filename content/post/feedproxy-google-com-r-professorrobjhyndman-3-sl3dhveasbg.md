title: A new tidy data structure to support exploration and modeling of temporal data

description: 'Mining temporal data for information is often inhibited by a multitude
  of formats: irregular or multiple time intervals, point events that need aggregating,
  multiple observational units or repeated measurements on multiple individuals, and
  heterogeneous data types. On the other hand, the software supporting time series
  modeling and forecasting, makes strict assumptions on the data to be provided, typically
  requiring a matrix of numeric data with implicit time indexes. Going from raw data
  to model-ready data is painful.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/SL3DHveaSBg
