  Happy World Ocean Day!
  World Ocean Day is a day of celebration and action to protect our shared ocean.
  While I already appreciate the importance of protecting sensitive ecosystems, including the ocean1, I found the idea of World Ocean Day especially touching.
  On World Ocean Day, people around our blue planet celebrate and honor our one shared ocean, that connects us all.
