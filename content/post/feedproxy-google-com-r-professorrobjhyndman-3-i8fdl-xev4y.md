  This week I’ve been attending the Functional Data and Beyond workshop at the Matrix centre in Creswick.
  I spoke yesterday about using ggplot2 for functional data graphics, rather than the custom-built plotting functionality available in the many functional data packages, including my own rainbow package written with Hanlin Shang.
  It is a much more powerful and flexible way to work, so I thought it would be useful to share some examples.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/i8FdL-xeV4Y" height="1" width="1" ...
