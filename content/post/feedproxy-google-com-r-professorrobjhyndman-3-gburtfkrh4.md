description: Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due
  to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series
  are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series,
  a constraint we refer to as &ldquo;coherence&rdquo;. Forecast reconciliation is
  the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm
  proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator
  that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.<img
