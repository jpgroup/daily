description: Forecasting groups of time series is of increasing practical importance,
  e.g. forecasting the demand for multiple products offered by a retailer or server
  loads within a data center. The local approach to this problem considers each time
  series separately and fits a function or model to each series. The global approach
  fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time series, global
  methods outperform the more established local methods.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/rY19iBiI0wQ"
