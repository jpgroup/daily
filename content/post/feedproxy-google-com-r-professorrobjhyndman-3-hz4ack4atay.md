description: Presentation given at UNSW It is becoming increasingly common for organizations
  to collect very large amounts of data over time. Data visualization is essential
  for exploring and understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual
  observations. However, the sheer quantity of data available means that new time
  series visualisation methods are needed. I will demonstrate an approach to this
  problem using a vector of features on each time series, measuring characteristics
  of the series.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/hz4aCK4aTAY"
