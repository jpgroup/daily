description: Hierarchical forecasting (HF) is needed in many situations in the supply
  chain (SC) because managers often need different levels of forecasts at different
  levels of SC to make a decision. Top-Down (TD), Bottom-Up (BU) and Optimal Combination
  (COM) are common HF models. These approaches are static and often ignore the dynamics
  of the series while disaggregating them. Consequently, they may fail to perform
  well if the investigated group of time series are subject to large changes such
  as during the periods of promotional sales.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/Ja2l
