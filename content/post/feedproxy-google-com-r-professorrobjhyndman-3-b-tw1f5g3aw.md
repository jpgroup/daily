description: Providing forecasts for ultra-long time series plays a vital role in
  various activities, such as investment decisions, industrial production arrangements,
  and farm management. This paper develops a novel distributed forecasting framework
  to tackle challenges associated with forecasting ultra-long time series by utilizing
  the industry-standard MapReduce framework. The proposed model combination approach
  facilitates distributed time series forecasting by combining the local estimators
  of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models delivered from worker
  nodes and minimizing a global ...
