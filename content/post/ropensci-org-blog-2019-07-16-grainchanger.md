  The grainchanger package provides functionality for data aggregation to a coarser resolution via moving-window or direct methods.
  Why do we need new methods for data aggregation? As landscape ecologists and macroecologists, we often need to aggregate data in order to harmonise datasets. In doing so, we often lose a lot of information about the spatial structure and environmental heterogeneity of data measured at finer resolution.
  The issues around scale disconnects are both conceptual and ...
