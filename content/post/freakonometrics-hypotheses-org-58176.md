description: With Alfred Galichon and Lucas Vernet, we recently uploaded a paper entitled
  optimal transport on large networks on arxiv. This article presents a set of tools
  for the modeling of a spatial allocation problem in a large geographic market and
  gives examples of applications. In our settings, the market is described by a network
  that maps the cost of travel between each pair of adjacent locations. Two types
  of agents are located at the nodes of this network. The buyers choose the most competitive
