description: <p>Using data from 10 series of The Great British Bake Off, we will walk
  through eleven ways to visualize the same data using the <code>ggplot2</code> package.
  We&rsquo;ll talk a lot about geoms and variable mappings, but also about what it
  means to &ldquo;tidy your data&rdquo;, plus the new pivot functions in the <code>tidyr</code>
  package.</p> <p>You won&rsquo;t need your laptops but you will get the most out
  of this talk if you know some basics about using <code>ggplot2</code>. To brush
  up (or start learning now), you may want to play with the free RStudio.cloud <a
