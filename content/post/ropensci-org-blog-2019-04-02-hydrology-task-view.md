  on Earth, water research cuts across numerous disciplines including hydrology, meteorology,
  geography, climate science, engineering, ecology, and more. Numerous R packages
  have emerged from this diversity of approaches, and we recently gathered many of
  them into a new rOpenSci task view which we broadly titled &lsquo;Hydrology&rsquo;
