description: Talk given at Macquarie University, Sydney. It is common to forecast
  at different levels of aggregation. For example, a retail company will want national
  forecasts, state forecasts, and store-level forecasts. And they will want them for
  all products, for groups of products, and for individual products. Forecast reconciliation
  methods allow for the forecasts at all levels of aggregation to be adjusted so they
  are consistent with each other.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/OLSvWyR256k"
