  On the journey of achieving reproducibility in genomic data analysis projects, one often faces challenges with documenting workflows and computations systematically. To provide one way for tackling these problems, we (me and my colleagues) have recently released two new R packages — tidycwl and biocompute — to CRAN.
  tidycwl As the name implies, the package tidycwl aims at offering a native toolchain for R to analyze tools and workflows written in the Common Workflow Language (CWL), while following the tidyverse design ...
