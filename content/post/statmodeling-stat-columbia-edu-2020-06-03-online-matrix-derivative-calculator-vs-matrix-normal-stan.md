description: I&#8217;m implementing the matrix normal distribution for Stan, which
  provides a multivariate density for a matrix with covariance factored into row and
  column covariances. The motivation A new colleague of mine at Flatiron&#8217;s Center
  for Comp Bio, Jamie Morton, is using the matrix normal to model the ocean biome.
