  <script src="https://alison.rbind.io/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js"></script> <p>This four-hour workshop will provide a gentle introduction to machine learning with R using the modern suite of predictive modeling packages called <a href="https://github.com/tidymodels">tidymodels</a>. We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we’ll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, the holdout method, the bias-variance trade-off, ensembling, cross-validation, and feature engineering. Learners will gain knowledge about good ...
