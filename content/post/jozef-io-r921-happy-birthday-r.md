  <p>It is almost the 29th of February 2020! A day that is very interesting for R, because it marks 20 years from the release of R v1.0.0, the first official public release of the R programming language.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>In this post, we will look back on the 20 years of R with a bit of history and 3 interesting perspectives - how much faster did R get over the years, how many R packages were being released since 2000 and how did the number of package downloads grow.</p>
