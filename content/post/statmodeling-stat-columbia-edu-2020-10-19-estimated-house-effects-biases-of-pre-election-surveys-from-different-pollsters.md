description: Elliott provides the above estimates from our model. As we&#8217;ve discussed,
  as part of our fitting procedure we estimate various biases, capturing in different
  ways the fact that surveys are not actually random samples of voters from an &#8220;urn.&#8221;
  One of these biases is the &#8220;house effect.&#8221; In our model, everything&#8217;s
