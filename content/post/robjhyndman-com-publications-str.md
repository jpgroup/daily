description: 'We propose a new method for decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend
  decomposition using Regression). Unlike other decomposition methods, STR allows
  for multiple seasonal and cyclic components, covariates, seasonal patterns that
  may have non-integer periods, and seasonality with complex topology. It can be used
  for time series with any regular time index including hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
  or quarterly data. It is competitive with existing methods when they exist, but
  tackles many more decomposition problem than other methods ...'
