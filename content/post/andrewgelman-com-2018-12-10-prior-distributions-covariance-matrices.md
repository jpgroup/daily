  <p>Someone sent me a question regarding the inverse-Wishart prior distribution for covariance matrix, as it is the default in some software he was using. Inverse-Wishart does not make sense for prior distribution; it has problems because the shape and scale are tangled. See this paper, &#8220;Visualizing Distributions of Covariance Matrices,&#8221; by Tomoki Tokuda, Ben Goodrich, [&#8230;]</p>
