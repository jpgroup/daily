  library(tidyverse) library(tsibble) library(readabs) library(raustats) Australian data analysts will know how frustrating it is to work with time series data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They are stored as multiple ugly Excel files (each containing multiple sheets) with inconsistent formatting, embedded comments, meta data stored along with the actual data, dates stored in a painful Excel format, and so on.
  Fortunately there are now a couple of R packages available to make this a little easier.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/7eIWxiOTJWY" ...
