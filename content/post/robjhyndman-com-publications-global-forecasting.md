description: Forecasting of groups of time series (e.g. demand for multiple products
  offered by a retailer, server loads within a data center or the number of completed
  ride shares in zones within a city) can be approached locally, by considering each
  time series as a separate regression task and fitting a function to each, or globally,
  by fitting a single function to all time series in the set. While global methods
  can outperform local for groups composed of similar time series, recent empirical
  evidence shows surprisingly good performance on heterogeneous ...
