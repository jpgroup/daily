description: A particular focus of water-quality monitoring is the concentrations
  of sediments and nutrients in rivers, constituents that can smother biota and cause
  eutrophication. However, the physical and economic constraints of manual sampling
  prohibit data collection at the frequency required to capture adequately the variation
  in concentrations through time. Here, we developed models to predict total suspended
  solids (TSS) and oxidized nitrogen (NOx) concentrations based on high-frequency
  time series of turbidity, conductivity and river level data from low-cost in situ
  sensors in rivers flowing into  ...
