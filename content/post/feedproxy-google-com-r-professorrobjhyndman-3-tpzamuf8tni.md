description: Talk given at the 2020 R conference, New York. For over 50 years we have
  known that ensemble forecasts perform better than individual methods, yet they are
  not as widely used as they should be. Perhaps this is because users think it is
  more work, or that it is hard to get prediction intervals, or that it is difficult
  to determine the relative weights of the component methods. The fable package solves
  these problems and makes it easy to produce probabilistic forecasts using ensembles
  across many time series.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/TPZAMUF8tNI"
