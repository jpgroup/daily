   <p>A maintenance release 0.9.12 of the RcppClassic package arrived earlier today on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>. This package provides a maintained version of the otherwise deprecated initial Rcpp API which <em>no new projects should use</em> as the normal Rcpp API is so much better.</p>
  <p>Changes are all internal. Testing is now done via <a href="http://cloud.r-project.org/package=tinytest">tinytest</a>, vignettes are now pre-built and at the request of CRAN we no longer strip the resulting library. No other changes were made.</p>
