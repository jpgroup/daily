title: Predicting the whole distribution with methods for depth data analysis demonstrated
  on a colorectal cancer treatment study

description: We demonstrate the utility of predicting the whole distribution of an
  outcome rather than a marginal change. We overcome inconsistent data modelling techniques
  in a real world problem. A model based on additive quantile regression and boosting
  was used to predict the whole distribution of length of hospital stay (LOS) following
  colorectal cancer surgery. The model also assessed the association of hospital and
  patient characteristics over the whole distribution of LOS.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/1yNsmuwaJFY"
