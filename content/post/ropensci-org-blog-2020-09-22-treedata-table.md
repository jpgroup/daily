  The data.table package enables high-performance extended functionality for data tables in R. treedata.table is a wrapper for data.table for phylogenetic analyses that matches a phylogeny to the data.table, and preserves matching during data.table operations. Using the data.table package greatly increases analysis reproducibility and the efficiency of data manipulation operations over other ways of performing similar tasks in base R, enabling processing of larger trees and datasets.
