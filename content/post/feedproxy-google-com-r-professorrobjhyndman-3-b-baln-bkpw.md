description: Functional autoregressive models are popular for functional time series
  analysis, but the standard formulation fails to address seasonal behaviour in functional
  time series data. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce seasonal functional
  autoregressive time series models. For the model of order one, we derive sufficient
  stationarity conditions and limiting behavior, and provide estimation and prediction
  methods. Some properties of the general order $P$ model are also presented. The
  merits of these models are demonstrated using simulation studies and via an application
  to real data.<img ...
