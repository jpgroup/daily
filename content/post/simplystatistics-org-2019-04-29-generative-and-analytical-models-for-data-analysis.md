description: ' <p>Describing how a data analysis is created is a topic of keen interest
  to me and there are a few different ways to think about it. Two different ways of
  thinking about data analysis are what I call the “generative” approach and the “analytical”
  approach. Another, more informal, way that I like to think about these approaches
  is as the “biological” model and the “physician” model. Reading through the literature

  rather than the latter and I think that presents an opportunity for new and interesting
  work.</p> ...'
