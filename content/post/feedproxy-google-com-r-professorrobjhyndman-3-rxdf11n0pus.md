description: COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on many industries around the world
  including tourism, and policy makers are interested in mapping out what the recovery
  path will look like. In this paper we focus on Australian tourism, analysing international
  arrivals and domestic flows. Both sectors have been severely affected by travel
  restrictions in the form of international and interstate border closures and regional
  lockdowns. We use statistical models of historical data to generate COVID-free counterfactual
  forecasts pretending that the pandemic never occurred.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.co
