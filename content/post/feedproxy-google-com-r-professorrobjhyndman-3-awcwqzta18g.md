description: This paper demonstrates that the performance of various outlier detection
  methods depends sensitively on both the data normalization schemes employed, as
  well as characteristics of the datasets. Recasting the challenge of understanding
  these dependencies as an algorithm selection problem, we perform the first instance
  space analysis of outlier detection methods. Such analysis enables the strengths
  and weaknesses of unsupervised outlier detection methods to be visualized and insights
  gained into which method and normalization scheme should be selected to obtain the
  most likely best performance  ...
