description: "\n        \n\n<p>Right now I&rsquo;m giving a talk at the RStudio Conference
  in San Diego. In my talk, I told the audience that I was going to write a blog post
  at the podium during my presentation. I only had 20 minutes in total for my presentation.
  Apparently it was impossible to type a nontrivial post. But I want to show them
  my work flow of writing and publishing blog posts, so I cheated using the <strong>rstudioapi</strong>
  package to automatically &ldquo;type&rdquo; the post in RStudio for me"
