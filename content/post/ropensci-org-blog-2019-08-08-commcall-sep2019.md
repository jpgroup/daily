description: Ambitious workflows in R, such as machine learning analyses, can be difficult
  to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and
  routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You
  can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such
  projects with the drake R package. drake resolves the dependency structure of your
  analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with
  optional distributed computing, and organizes the output so you rarely have to think
