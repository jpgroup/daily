   <p>The <a href="https://github.com/yihui/formatR">formatR package</a> is 11 years old now.
  Interestingly, my <a href="/en/2007/08/tidy-up-your-r-code/">very first English blog

  some soft dependencies, but they do not affect the core functionality.</p> <pre><code class="language-sh">$ wc -l R/*.R 33 R/eval.R 10 R/shiny.R ...
