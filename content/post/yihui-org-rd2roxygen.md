   <p>The package <a href="https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen"><strong>Rd2roxygen</strong></a> helps R package developers who
  used to write R documentation in the raw LaTeX-like commands but now want to
  switch their documentation to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2"><strong>roxygen2</strong></a>, which is a
  convenient tool for developers, since we can write documentation as inline
  comments, e.g.</p> <pre><code class="language-r">## the source code of the function `parse_and_save`
  ex.file = system.file(&quot;examples&quot;, &quot;parse_and_save.R&quot;, package = ...
disable_comments: true
