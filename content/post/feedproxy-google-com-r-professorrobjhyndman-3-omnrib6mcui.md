description: We develop a framework for prediction of multivariate data that follow
  some known linear constraints, such as the example where some variables are aggregates
  of others. This is particularly common when forecasting time series (predicting
  the future), but also arises in other types of prediction. For point prediction,
  an increasingly popular technique is reconciliation, whereby predictions are made
  for all series (so-called &ldquo;base&rdquo; predictions) and subsequently adjusted
  to ensure coherence with the constraints.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/oMNRIB6mC
