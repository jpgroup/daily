description: Presentation to ACEMS/MATRIX Conference on Functional Data Analysis Functional
  autoregressive models have been widely used in functional time series analysis,
  but no attention has been given to handling seasonality within this framework. I
  will discuss a proposed seasonal functional autoregressive model, and explore some
  of its statistical properties including stationarity conditions and limiting behaviour.
  I will also look at methods for estimation and prediction of seasonal functional
  autoregressive time series of order one.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/wlP
