  There have been some great data visualizations produced of COVID-19 case and deaths data, the best known of which is the graph from John Burn-Murdoch in the Financial Times. To my knowledge, it was first used by Matt Cowgill from the Grattan Institute, and has been widely copied. This is a great visualization and has helped introduce log-scale graphics to a wide audience.
  Reproducing the Financial Times cumulative confirmed cases graph To produce something like it, we can use the tidycovid19 package from Joachim Gassen:<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/mLvypLqv2H ...
