description: Presentation to MATRIX Workshop on Functional Data Analysis and Beyond
  Any good data analysis begins with a careful graphical exploration of the observed
  data. For functional time series data, this area of statistical analysis has been
  largely neglected. I will look at the tools that are available such as rainbow plots
  and functional box plots, and propose several new tools including functional ACF
  plots, functional season plots, calendar plots, and embedded pairwise distance plots.<img
