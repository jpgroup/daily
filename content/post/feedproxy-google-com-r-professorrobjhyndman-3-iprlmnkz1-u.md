description: Invited talk for ISI-WSC 2019 in Kuala Lumpur Many large organizations
  need to forecast huge numbers of related time series every week. Manufacturing companies
  forecast product demand to plan their supply chains; call centres forecast call
  volume to inform staff scheduling; technology companies forecast web traffic to
  maintain service levels; energy companies forecast electricity demand to prevent
  blackouts. In each case, what is required is a high-dimensional probabilistic forecast
  describing multivariate quantiles of the uncertain future, not a vector of point
  forecasts.<img ...
