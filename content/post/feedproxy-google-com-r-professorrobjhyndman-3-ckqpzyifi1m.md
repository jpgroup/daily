description: A geometric interpretation is developed for so-called reconciliation
  methodologies used to forecast time series that adhere to known linear constraints.
  In particular, a general framework is established that nests many existing popular
  reconciliation methods within the class of projections. This interpretation facilitates
  the derivation of novel theoretical results. First, reconciliation via projection
  is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy with respect to a class of loss functions
  based on a generalised distance metric.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/cKQpz
