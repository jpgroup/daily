  Load packages library(tidyverse) library(mosaic) library(plotly) library(scatterplot3d) Motivation Linear models are a standard way of predicting or explaining some data. Visualizing data is not only of didactical value but provides heuristical value too, as demonstrated by Anscombe’s Quartet.
  Visualizing linear models in 2D is straightforward, but visualizing linear models with more than one predictor is much less so. The aim of this post is to demonstrate some ways do visualize linear models with more than one predictor, using popular R ...
