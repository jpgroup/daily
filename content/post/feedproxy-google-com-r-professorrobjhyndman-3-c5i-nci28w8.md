description: This paper introduces DOBIN, a new approach to select a set of basis
  vectors tailored for outlier detection. DOBIN has a solid mathematical foundation
  and can be used as a dimension reduction tool for outlier detection tasks. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of DOBIN on an extensive data repository, by comparing the performance
  of outlier detection methods using DOBIN and other bases. We further illustrate
  the utility of DOBIN as an outlier visualization tool.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/c5I-nci28w8"
