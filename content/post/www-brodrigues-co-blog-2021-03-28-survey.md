  <p>I’m curious about different keyboard layouts, and how that correlates with typing speed (if at all).
  I prepared a little 2 minute survey, and would be very grateful if you could take it. You can
  find it on this <a href="https://forms.gle/vprM4C8yk1bBGCNx8">link</a>.</p>
  <p>There’s no R code in this blog ...
