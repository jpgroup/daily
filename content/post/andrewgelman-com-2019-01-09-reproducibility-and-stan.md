  <p>Aki prepared these slides which cover a series of topics, starting with notebooks, open code, and reproducibility of code in R and Stan; then simulation-based calibration of algorithms; then model averaging and prediction. Lots to think about here: there are many aspects to reproducible analysis and computation in statistics.</p>
