title: 'Bayes, statistics, and reproducibility:  “Many serious problems with statistics
  in practice arise from Bayesian inference that is not Bayesian enough, or frequentist
  evaluation that is not frequentist enough, in both cases using replication distributions
  that do not make scientific sense or do not reflect the actual procedures being
  performed on the data.”'
