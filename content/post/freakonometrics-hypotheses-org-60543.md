description: When introducing the SIR model, in our initial post, we got an ordinary
  differential equation, but we did not really discuss stability, and periodicity.
  It has to do with the Jacobian matrix of the system. But first of all, we had three
  equations for three function, but actuallyso it means that our problem is here simply
  in dimension 2. Henceand therefore, the Jacobian of the system isWe should evaluate
  the Jacobian at the equilibrium, i.e. andWe should then look at eigenvalues of the
