description: I&#8217;m reading a really dense and beautifully written survey of Monte
  Carlo gradient estimation for machine learning by Shakir Mohamed, Mihaela Rosca,
  Michael Figurnov, and Andriy Mnih. There are great explanations of everything including
  variance reduction techniques like coupling, control variates, and Rao-Blackwellization.
  The latter&#8217;s the topic of today&#8217;s post, as it relates directly to ...
