  The RcppEnsmallen package brings to R a Header-Only C++ Mathematical Optimization Library for Armadillo. In particular, Ensmallen is a templated C++ mathematical optimization library (by the MLPACK team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective function to optimize.
  With Comprehensive R Archival Network on vacation for two weeks, we missed out on the Ensmallen Development Team Christmas release until now. The latest build adds three new optimizers: AdaBound, AMSBound, and ...
