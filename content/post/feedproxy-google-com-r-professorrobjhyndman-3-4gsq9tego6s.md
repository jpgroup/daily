  There are now translations of my forecasting textbook (coauthored with George Athanasopoulos) into Chinese and Korean.
  The Chinese translation was produced by a team led by Professor Yanfei Kang (Beihang University) and Professor Feng Li (Central University of Finance and Economics). The following students were also involved: Cheng Fan, Liu Yu, Long Xiaoyu, Wang Xiaoqian, Zeng Jiayue, Zhang Bohan, and Zhu Shuaidong.
  The Korean translation was produced by Dr Daniel Young Ho Kim.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJHyndman/~4/4gsq9tEgo6s" height="1" width="1" ...
