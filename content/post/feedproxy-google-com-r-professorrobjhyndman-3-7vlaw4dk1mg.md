description: Manifold learning algorithms are valuable tools for the analysis of high-dimensional
  data, many of which include a step where nearest neighbors of all observations are
  found. This can present a computational bottleneck when the number of observations
  is large or when the observations lie in more general metric spaces, such as statistical
  manifolds, which require all pairwise distances between observations to be computed.
  We resolve this problem by using a broad range of approximate nearest neighbor algorithms
  within manifold learning algorithms and evaluating their impact on embedding ...
